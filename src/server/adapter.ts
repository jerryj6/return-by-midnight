/**
 * adapter.ts — the seam between the room server and each game.
 *
 * The room server owns room lifecycle, authoritative ordering, revisioning,
 * idempotency, reconnect windows and transport. Everything puzzle-specific —
 * what a command means, whether it is legal, what it changes, and how the
 * canonical game state serializes — is delegated to a GameAdapter.
 *
 * A GameAdapter MUST be deterministic and free of I/O: given the same room
 * state and the same accepted command sequence it must produce the same
 * states, events, snapshot bytes and hashes on every machine. Wall-clock
 * decisions belong to the room server, never to puzzle outcomes.
 *
 * `room.state` is opaque to the server: it is only ever passed back to the
 * adapter (validate/apply/snapshot/hash/restore) and hashed canonically for
 * convergence checks. It must remain JSON-serializable.
